# Pace gets organised ðŸ“…

Thank you for taking the time to interview with Pace! We have a coding exercise we would like you to do to show us your skills, and give us something to talk about in our technical interview.

## Expectations

The exercise was designed to be solvable in an afternoon, yet a robust and comprehensive solution could take much longer. Rather than building a complete solution, please constrain yourself to around **three hours**, and use a shortup writeup to mention anything not achieved or any known limitations.

## Requirements

![Example](./example.png)

We would like to build a simple day view for a calendar, populated with data from a graphql API. The API returns a list of events which have a start and end time in minutes since midnight. So 9am is 540 minutes, 9.30 is 570 minutes and so on.

When rendering the calendar:

- Events should be shown without any overlapping
- If multiple events collide, then they should have equal width
- Styling can be kept extremely simple
- We only need to display the events

Your submission should also be reflective of how you would write production quality code, but don't fret if you run out of time - we aren't expecting polished solutions.

## Writeup

Written communication and thoughtful self-reflection is an important part of our work. This is an opportunity for you to tell us a bit more about the work you did. The writeup shouldnâ€™t be long, but we will use it as part of the evaluation and discuss it in subsequent interview, so you should spend a bit of time and focus on it.

Here are some example questions your writeup could address:

- What choices did you make and why?
- What challenges did you face?
- What tradeoffs did you choose?
- What do you like and not like about your solution?
- What areas would you work on next?

We love feedback. If thereâ€™s anything you think could be improved with this exercise, please share your thoughts in the writeup, too.

## Technologies

We've gotten you started using a [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) boilerplate including sample data. If you're not familar with the framework then no problem, we don't use any of its additional features here or require server-side rendering. To complete the requirements:

- You may use any open source, publicly available third party libraries or components you would like **except calendar components like [fullcalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/)**.
- You may use any testing framework or approach you prefer, or not write tests at all.

## Deliverables

We expect you to deliver:

1. Source code of a web app that fulfils, as far as possible, the above requirements and uses the specified technologies, delivered in form of a Git repository. The Repository can be public or private, on GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket, CodeSandboxed, or zipped and emailed to us.
2. A short writeup of your work in form of a Markdown readme in the project.

Good Luck and have fun!

Once completed, please email your solution to ben@pacerevenue.com. If you have any questions, please let us know!
